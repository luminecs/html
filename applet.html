<p style="color: orangered;">Not supported in HTML5</p>

<p>The &lt;applet&gt; tag was used in earlier versions of HTML to embed Java applets into web pages. However, it is no longer supported in HTML5 and should not be used in modern web development.</p>

<p>Java applets are small programs written in the Java programming language that can be embedded into web pages and run within a user's web browser. They were popular in the late 1990s and early 2000s, but have since been largely replaced by other technologies, such as JavaScript and HTML5.</p>

<p>If you need to embed interactive content into your web page, you can use modern web technologies such as HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. These technologies provide more flexibility and interactivity than Java applets and are supported by all modern web browsers.</p>

<p>In summary, the &lt;applet&gt; tag is no longer supported in modern web development and should not be used. If you need to embed interactive content into your web page, you should use modern web technologies such as HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
