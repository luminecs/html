<p>The &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; tag is used in HTML documents to indicate the version of HTML being used. It is typically placed at the very beginning of an HTML document before the &lt;html&gt; tag.</p>

<p>The &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; declaration starts with the keyword &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; followed by the type of document declaration, which is usually the version of HTML being used.</p>

<p>By including the &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; tag, the browser knows what version of HTML is being used and can render the page accordingly. It is important to use the correct &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; declaration for the version of HTML being used to ensure that the page is displayed correctly.</p>
