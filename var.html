<p>The &lt;var&gt; tag in HTML is used to define a variable in a programming code or to indicate a variable in a mathematical expression. It can also be used to represent a placeholder for user input or content that is subject to change. When displayed in a web page, the text within the &lt;var&gt; tag is usually rendered in italics to distinguish it from other content.</p>

<h4>Source Code</h4>
<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;The area of a circle with a radius of &lt;var&gt;r&lt;/var&gt; is calculated using the formula A = &pi;r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>

<h4>Output</h4>
<p>The area of a circle with a radius of <var>r</var> is calculated using the formula A = Ï€r<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p>In the above example, the variable &quot;r&quot; is defined within the &lt;var&gt; tag and is used in a mathematical formula to calculate the area of a circle. The &lt;sup&gt; tag is also used to display &quot;r&quot; as a superscript, indicating that it is squared in the formula.</p>
