<p>The &lt;dfn&gt; tag in HTML is used to indicate the definition of a term in a document. The term being defined is typically enclosed within the &lt;dfn&gt; tag, and can be styled with CSS to indicate its meaning or significance.</p>

<hr>

<h4>Source Code</h4>
<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;dfn&gt;HTML&lt;/dfn&gt; is a markup language used to create web pages.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>

<h4>Output</h4>
<p><dfn>HTML</dfn> is a markup language used to create web pages.</p>

<hr>

<p>In the above example, the term &quot;HTML&quot; is enclosed within the &lt;dfn&gt; tag to indicate that it is being defined. The definition itself is not included within the tag, but can be provided elsewhere in the document.</p>

<p>The &lt;dfn&gt; tag is part of the HTML5 specification and is supported by all major web browsers. It is primarily used for semantic purposes, to provide additional information about the meaning of terms used in a document.</p>
