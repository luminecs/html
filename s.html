<p>The &lt;s&gt; tag is used to represent text that has been deleted or struck through.</p>

<hr/>

<h4>Source Code</h4>
<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;s&gt;not&lt;/s&gt; a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>

<h4>Output</h4>
<p>This is <s>not</s> a good idea.</p>

<hr/>

<p>In this example, the word "not" is struck through to indicate that it has been deleted from the original text. The resulting text would be "This is a good idea."</p>
