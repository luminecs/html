<p>The &lt;del&gt; tag in HTML is used to indicate that text has been deleted or removed from a document. This tag is often used in conjunction with the &lt;ins&gt; tag, which is used to indicate inserted text.</p>

<hr/>

<h4>Source Code</h4>
<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;John's old phone number was &lt;del&gt;(555) 123-4567&lt;/del&gt;, but his new number is &lt;ins&gt;(555) 987-6543&lt;/ins&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>

<h4>Output</h4>
<p>John's old phone number was <del>(555) 123-4567</del>, but his new number is <ins>(555) 987-6543</ins>.</p>

<hr/>

<p>In the above example, the &lt;del&gt; tag is used to indicate that the old phone number has been deleted, while the &lt;ins&gt; tag is used to indicate the new phone number that has been inserted. When rendered by a web browser, the deleted text will typically be displayed with a line through it.</p>

<p>The &lt;del&gt; tag is part of the HTML 4.01 specification and is supported by all major web browsers.</p>
