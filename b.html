<p>The &lt;b&gt; tag in HTML is used to apply bold formatting to text. It is a semantic tag that should be used to indicate text that has greater importance or is more relevant than other text.</p>

<hr/>

<h4>Source Code</h4>
<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;This paragraph contains some &lt;b&gt;important&lt;/b&gt; text.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>

<h4>Output</h4>
<p>This paragraph contains some <b>important</b> text.</p>

<hr/>

<p>In the above example, the &lt;b&gt; tag is used to indicate that the word &quot;important&quot; is more significant than the other text in the paragraph. When rendered in a web browser, the text enclosed in the &lt;b&gt; tag will be displayed in bold.</p>

<p>It is important to note that the &lt;b&gt; tag should not be used solely for visual formatting purposes. Instead, it should be used to indicate the importance or relevance of text. If you want to apply bold formatting for visual purposes only, you should use CSS styling instead.</p>
