<p>The &lt;wbr&gt; tag is used in HTML to indicate a word break opportunity, which allows the browser to break a long word at a point where there is no space, hyphen or other character to separate it. This can be useful for improving the readability of long paragraphs, especially on smaller screens.</p>
