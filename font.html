<p style="color: orangered;">Not supported in HTML5</p>

<p>The &lt;font&gt; tag is an old HTML tag used to specify the font face, size, and color of text. However, it has been deprecated in HTML5, which means it is no longer recommended for use.</p>

<p>Instead, it is recommended to use CSS to style text. CSS allows for much more control and flexibility in styling text, and it separates the style from the content, which makes it easier to maintain and update.</p>

<h4>Source Code</h4>
<pre><code>&lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px; color: red;&quot;&gt;This is some text styled with CSS.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>

<h4>Output</h4>
<p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px; color: red;">This is some text styled with CSS.</p>

<hr>

<p>In this example, we are setting the font family to Arial, the font size to 16 pixels, and the color to red.</p>

<p>Note that it is generally better to define CSS styles in an external stylesheet rather than inline in the HTML code. This allows for better organization and easier maintenance.</p>
