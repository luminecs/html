<p style="color: orangered;">Not supported in HTML5</p>

<p>The &lt;acronym&gt; tag is an HTML tag that was once used to define an acronym, which is an abbreviation that is pronounced as a word (such as NASA). However, the &lt;acronym&gt; tag is no longer supported in HTML5 and should not be used in modern web development.</p>

<p>Instead, the &lt;abbr&gt; tag should be used to define abbreviations and acronyms in HTML. The &lt;abbr&gt; tag provides the same functionality as the &lt;acronym&gt; tag, but it is supported in all modern browsers and is part of the HTML5 specification.</p>
