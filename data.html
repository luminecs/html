<p>The &lt;data&gt; tag in HTML is used to associate data with the content it is related to. This can be useful in cases where you want to add additional information or metadata to an element, without affecting the way it is displayed.</p>

<hr/>

<h4>Source Code</h4>
<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;The average temperature in &lt;data value=&quot;New York&quot;&gt;NYC&lt;/data&gt; today is 65 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>

<h4>Output</h4>
<p>The average temperature in <data value="New York">NYC</data> today is 65 degrees.</p>

<hr/>

<p>In the above example, the &lt;data&gt; tag is used to associate the value &quot;New York&quot; with the content &quot;NYC&quot;. This allows you to add metadata to the element without changing the way it is displayed. Additionally, the &quot;value&quot; attribute is used to specify the actual data value that is associated with the element.</p>

<p>You can use CSS to style the &lt;data&gt; tag, just like you would with any other HTML element. By default, the content inside the &lt;data&gt; tag is displayed in the same way as the surrounding text, but you can use CSS to change its appearance if needed.</p>

<p>The &lt;data&gt; tag is commonly used in combination with the &lt;time&gt; tag, which is used to represent a specific date or time. By using these tags together, you can provide additional context and metadata to your content.</p>
